# Redis
To have launchd start redis now and restart at login:
  brew services start redis
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

# Queue
To have launchd start the dealzilla worker queue:
  cp com.dealzilla.queue.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
  chmod +x /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.dealzilla.queue.plist
  sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.dealzilla.queue.plist
To stop that
  sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.dealzilla.queue.plist
