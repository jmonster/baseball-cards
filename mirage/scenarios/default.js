Do you wonder what is holding you back from thriving in the world? In our hectic world we often find ourselves afraid to take risks that could jeopardize the stable lives we've created for ourselves. We remain in jobs, relationships and old patterns that no longer work, while symptoms such as anxiety, depression, stress, anger and self-defeating patterns keep us from making real changes to our lives.",

If you've worked hard to get where you are, but are still fighting to feel at home in your own body or safe in your relationships, you've come to the right place.  I like to think of myself as a playful, perceptive, and down-to-earth navigator in the search for clarity and confidence. I find this approach is very strong with people struggling with disordered eating, poor body image, anxiety, and relationships.",
